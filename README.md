## FAQ

Q: Where is the source code?
A: The project is in early alpha and changed constantly. We are working on building a vision for the product, but when it will stabilize we are planning to open source all or most of it. 

Q: Will it be paid in future?
A: No functionality that is now available will be paid. We are thinking of commercial plugins for enterprises with things like LDAP integration however core of the product will be always free.
