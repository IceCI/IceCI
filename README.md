## FAQ

_Q: Where can I find the source code?_

A: The project is in early alpha and is undergoing constant changes. We're still working on building a vision for the product - we're planning on opensourcing all (or most) of it once it's stabilized.

_Q: Will IceCI remain free?_

A: None of the currently available functionalities will become paid ones. We are considering introducing enterprise plugins (like LDAP integration, for example) sometime in the future, however the core of IceCI will _always_ remain free.
